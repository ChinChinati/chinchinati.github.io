I am currently a **Research Intern** at the **MARMOT Lab at the National University of Singapore (NUS)**, under the mentorship of [Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti](https://marmotlab.org/bio.html). I received my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT ISM), Dhanbad**.

My research journey has been enriched by mentorship from leading academics. I have worked on robotic grasping at **IIIT Allahabad** with [Prof. G.C. Nandi](https://robita.iiita.ac.in/pgcn.php) and [Andrew Melnik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6tiiQtgAAAAJ&hl=en). I was also fortunate to complete an internship at the **ERC Lab at National Taiwan Normal University**, guided by [Prof. Saeed Saeedvand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ljf3pYgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Jacky Baltes](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=557QR3kAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Shishir Kolathaya N.Y.](https://www.shishirny.com/) at the **Stochastic Robotics Lab, IISc Bangalore**, and with [Prof. Arun Dayal Udai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T1LKSLwAAAAJ&hl=en) at my home institution.
