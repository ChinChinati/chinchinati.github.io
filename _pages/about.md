I am a researcher focused on Embodied AI and AI in Robotics, aiming to develop intelligent systems that understand and adapt to their environments. My interest lies in how physical embodiment influences decision-making and aims to advance robot control systems that integrate perception, attention, and action for autonomous behavior. My goal is to create robots that learn and evolve in dynamic environments, with applications in manipulation, locomotion and cognitive robotics.

I am currently an undergraduate at IIT Dhanbad, where I have had the pleasure of working under the mentorship of [Prof. Arun Dayal Udai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T1LKSLwAAAAJ&hl=en). I was also fortunate to complete an internship at NTNU in Taiwan, where I was guided by [Prof. Saeed Saeedvand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ljf3pYgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Jacky Baltes]{https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=557QR3kAAAAJ&hl=en}. These experiences have significantly enriched my understanding of AI and robotics, equipping me with valuable insights into the field.
