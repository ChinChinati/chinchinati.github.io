# Development and Control of a Robot Using LQR Control  

This project focused on designing, simulating, and implementing a robotic system controlled by a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The work involved solving the mathematical model of the robot, developing the hardware from scratch, and validating the results through simulation and real-world testing.  

## Key Features and Contributions  

### 1. **Mathematical Modeling and Control Design**  
- Developed a precise mathematical model of the robotic system to understand its dynamics and behavior.  
- Designed an **LQR controller**, optimizing the control inputs to ensure stability and efficiency while minimizing energy usage and control effort.  

### 2. **Simulation in CoppeliaSim**  
- Simulated the robot and its control system in the **CoppeliaSim simulator**, verifying the accuracy of the mathematical model and the performance of the LQR controller in a virtual environment.  
- Fine-tuned the control parameters to achieve smooth and precise robotic motion.  

### 3. **Hardware Development and Implementation**  
- Built the robotic hardware from scratch, including structural, electronic, and actuation components.  
- Integrated the LQR control algorithm into the hardware, ensuring real-time control performance.  
- Successfully validated the hardware by replicating the results from the CoppeliaSim simulation, demonstrating consistency and reliability.  

## Key Achievements  
- Bridged the gap between simulation and hardware implementation, ensuring the LQR controller performed as expected in both environments.  
- Developed a fully functional robot with robust control, highlighting the synergy between theoretical modeling, simulation, and practical hardware development.
